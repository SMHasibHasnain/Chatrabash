## 🏛️ Engineered with Clean Architecture

This project adheres strictly to **Clean Architecture** principles combined with the **CQRS** pattern (via MediatR) to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

<div align="center">

<img src="designs\diagrams\clean_architecture.png" width="60%" alt="Clean Architecture Diagram">

</div>

* **Domain Layer:** The heart of the software. Contains Enterprise logic and entities. Has ZERO dependencies.
* **Application Layer:** Contains business logic, use cases, and MediatR Handlers (Commands & Queries).
* **Infrastructure/Persistence Layer:** Deals with external concerns like Databases (EF Core), File Storage, etc.
* **API Layer:** The entry point. Controllers are thin and only dispatch requests to the Application layer.
